## Are all OER digital?
### Answer: 
Like most educational resources these days, most OER are “born” digital. But like traditional resources, they can be made available to students in both digital and printed formats (including in the form of a traditional ‘textbook’).
Of course, digital OER are easier to share, modify, and redistribute, but being digital is not what makes something an OER or not.
