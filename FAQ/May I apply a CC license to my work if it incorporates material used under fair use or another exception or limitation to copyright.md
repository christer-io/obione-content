## May I apply a CC license to my work if it incorporates material used under fair use or another exception or limitation to copyright?

### Answer: 

Yes, but it is important to prominently mark any third party material you incorporate into your work so reusers do not think the CC license applies to that material. 

The CC license only applies to the rights you have in the work. For example, if your CC-licensed slide deck includes a Flickr image you are using pursuant to fair use, make sure to identify that image as not being subject to the CC license. For more information about incorporating work owned by others, see our page about marking third party content.
