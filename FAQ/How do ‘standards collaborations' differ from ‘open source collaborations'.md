## How do ‘standards collaborations' differ from ‘open source collaborations'
### Answer:
Standards and open source projects are different collaborations. They're different economic tools in a marketplace with different goals, outcomes, and processes:
1. Standards take longer to develop and change. Whereas open source projects can develop quickly, standards encourage multiple implementations and tend to enter a market with some maturity and competition. Standards and specifications don't change quickly, so they are developed with the expectation that they'll need to last for longer periods of time. For example, moving from HTML1.0 to HTML5 standard took about 18 years, and we've had TCP since 1981 with few changes.
2. Standards are consensus-based compromises. Open source projects are driven by contribution and meritocracy.
3. Standards define useful predictable boundaries. Well-run open source projects are the building blocks of rich, varied ecosystems.
