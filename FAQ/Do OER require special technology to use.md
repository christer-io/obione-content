## Do OER require special technology to use?

### Answer:

One of the great things about OER is that users have the right to turn it into any format they wish (which is almost always forbidden with traditional resources). Therefore, OER aren’t tied to a particular type of device or software, which gives students and schools more freedom in what technology they purchase. 

In cases where technology isn’t available, you can in most cases print the OER.
