## Why should I use the latest version of the Creative Commons licenses?

### Answer:

The latest version of the Creative Commons licenses is version 4.0. You should always use the latest version of the Creative Commons licenses in order to take advantage of the many improvements described on the [license versions page](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License%20Versions).
