## What happens if someone applies a Creative Commons license to my work without my knowledge or authorization?
### Answer:

CC [alerts prospective licensors](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Before_Licensing) they need to have all necessary rights before applying a CC license to a work. If that is not the case and someone has marked your work with a CC license without your authorization, you should contact that person and tell them to remove the license from your work. You may also wish to contact a lawyer.
